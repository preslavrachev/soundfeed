#SoundFeed

SoundFeed is a weekend project of mine, solving a very specific, but annoying problem. There are many great podcasts and shows on SoundCloud, but alas, not all of them are easy to listen to, on a generic podcast app. As far as I know, SoundCloud provides RSS exports of user accounts, but only after the user has applied, and has been approved to get one. 

I created SoundFeed with the simple idea, to allow myself, and other podcast fans, listen to their favorite shows, using their favorite podcast apps. Since RSS is still the de-facto standard for podcast syndication, SoundFeed allows you to export an RSS feed for your favorite show, just by pasting its SoundCloud link
